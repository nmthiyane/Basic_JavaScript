# Basic_JavaScript
This project contain 6 basic JS problems to solve. The problems are listed before: 

Write a program called SumOfTwoDice that prints the sum of two random integers between 1 and 6 (such as you might get when rolling dice). 

----------

Write a program called LeapYear which takes an argument N year (>= 1582) and tests if it is a leap year or not.

----------

In 1963 Samuel Pepys asked Isaac Newton which is more likely: getting 1 at least once when rolling a fair die six times or getting 1 at least twice when rolling it 12 times. Write a program PepysProblem that could have provided Newton with a quick answer. 

---------

Write a code fragment that reverses the order of a one-dimensional array a[] of double values. Do not create another array to hold the result. 

--------------

 Read in a sequence of words (*.txt file), separated by whitespace. Compute the number of times each word appears, and print, sorted by frequency.
